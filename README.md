# Doggo Select 

A Web App for open source dog pictures. You can see Randomly Generated Images of Dogs with Selected Breed. You can also Comment on a Particular Image.

This app uses [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to fetch images from [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) ( The internet's biggest collection
of open source dog pictures ).

The [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It will seem familiar to anyone who has used [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest), but the new API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set.
